\section{Introduction}

This document describes the design and implementation of the \emph{Panda Virtual File System} of group \emph{Panda}. The project is part of the course \emph{Java and C\# in depth} at ETH Zurich. The following sections describe each project phase, listing the requirements that were implemented and the design decisions taken. The last section describes a use case of using the \emph{Panda Virtual File System}.

% PART I: VFS CORE
% --------------------------------------

\section{VFS Core}

%TODO: Remove this text and replace it with actual content
\emph{Give a short description (1-2 paragraphs) of what VFS Core is.}


\subsection{Requirements}

% TODO: Remove this text and replace it with actual content
\emph{Describe which requirements (and possibly bonus requirements) you have implemented in this part. Give a quick description (1-2 sentences) of each requirement. List the software elements (classes and or functions) that are mainly involved in implementing each requirement.}


\subsection{Design}

% TODO: Remove this text and replace it with actual content
\emph{Give an overview of the design of this part and describe in general terms how the implementation works. You can mention design patterns used, class diagrams, definition of custom file formats, network protocols, or anything else that helps understand the implementation.}

\subsubsection{General Remarks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Offsets \& lengths in bytes.
	\item The VFS is organized in blocks with fixed BLOCK\_SIZE.
	\item All addresses are in number of blocks from 0 and of length 4 bytes.
	\item Only single links to blocks (not more than one hard-link) are allowed. This means that one file or directory can only be in one directory.
	\item Block address 0 is illegal, it means absence of a block.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metadata}

Metadata of the whole VFS starts at address 0.\\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|p{5cm}|}\hline
Offset (absolute)	&Length	&C\# data-type	&Description\\\hline
0	&4	&UInt32	&Number of blocks in entire VFS\\
4	&4	&UInt32	&BLOCK\_SIZE in bytes\\
8	&4	&UInt32	&Address of root directory node\\
12	&4	&UInt32	&Address of empty page block. Must never be 0\\
16	&4	&UInt32	&“break” in number of blocks, see empty space management.\\
20	&Blocksize -20	&UInt32	&Empty (initialized with 0)\\\hline
\end{tabular}

% TODO: Remove this text and replace it with actual content
\emph{If you have a command line interface for your VFS, describe here the commands available (e.g. ls, copy, import).} \\ \\ \\

% TODO: Remove this text and replace it with actual content
\emph{Describe how to realize the following use case with your system. Describe the steps involved and how to perform each action (e.g. command line executions and arguments, menu entries, keyboard shortcuts, screenshots). The use case is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start synchronization server on localhost.
\item Create account on synchronization server.
\item Create two VFS disks (on the same machine) and link them to the new account.
\item Import a directory (recursively) from the host file system into Disk 1.
\item Dispose Disk 1 after the synchronization finished.
\item Export the directory (recursively) from Disk 2 into the host file system.
\item Stop synchronization server.
\end{enumerate}
