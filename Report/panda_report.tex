\section{Introduction}

This document describes the design and implementation of the \emph{Panda Virtual File System} of group \emph{Pandas}. The project is part of the course \emph{Java and C\# in depth} at ETH Zurich. The following sections describe each project phase, listing the requirements that were implemented and the design decisions taken. The last section describes a use case of using the \emph{Panda Virtual File System}.

% PART I: VFS CORE
% --------------------------------------

\section{VFS Core}

The VFS Core is the system part of the virtual file system. It manages directories and files as we are used to it in other systems like linux.\\

We introduced a block system. Each block can be specified in one of 4 different types. To achieve code which can be good maintained we designed 3 layers. These block types are described in the Specification section and the layers are in the Design section.

\subsection{Requirements}

Each requirement which is listed is also implemented. The software elements which are involved can be found in the testmethod\newline Panda.Test/Integration/Specification.cs. The testclass is noted to each requirement.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{The virtual disk must be stored in a single file in the working directory in the host file system.}\\
		The whole VFS is stored in the instance disk which is created at the beginning.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_1\_and\_2
	\item \emph{VFS must support the creation of a new disk with the specified maximum size at the specified
location in the host file system.}\\
		Possible since we can create a VFS.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_1\_and\_2
	\item \emph{VFS must support several virtual disks in the host file system.}\\
		We can create n different disks with different files.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_3
	\item \emph{VFS must support disposing of the virtual disk.}\\
		Possible with Dispose()\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_4
	\item \emph{VFS must support creating/deleting/renaming directories and files.}\\
		Files support all these methods after they are initialized.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_5
	\item \emph{VFS must support navigation: listing of files and folders, and going to a location expressed by a
concrete path.}\\
		Since files and folders inherit from nodes we can store them in an list and loop trough them. With navigate() we can go to a concrete path.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_6
	\item \emph{VFS must support moving/copying directories and files, including hierarchy.}\\
		move() and copy() are implemented.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_7
	\item \emph{VFS must support importing files and directories from the host file system.}\\
		import() is implemented and reads from the system.io.stream\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_8\_and\_9
	\item \emph{VFS must support exporting files and directories to the host file system.}\\
		import() is implemented and writes to the system.io.stream\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_8\_and\_9
	\item \emph{VFS must support querying of free/occupied space in the virtual disk.}\\
		Size is implemented as an Field of diretory and file. To get the occupied space just ask root.\\
		Testclass: Req2\_1\_10
	\item \textbf{Bonus Basic:} \emph{Elastic disk: Virtual disk can dynamically grow or shrink, depending on its occupied space.}\\
		The intern data structure can already grow and shrink dynamically since we work with blocks.
	\item \textbf{Bonus Advanced:} \emph{Large data: This means, that VFS core can store \& operate amount of data, that can't fit to PC RAM ( typically, more than 4Gb).}\\
		To fullfill this taks we decided to work with a block structure. This implies automaticaly that we can sotre more than 4Gb.\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design}

% TODO: Remove this text and replace it with actual content
\emph{Give an overview of the design of this part and describe in general terms how the implementation works. You can mention design patterns used, class diagrams, definition of custom file formats, network protocols, or anything else that helps understand the implementation.}\\

The VFS Core is divided in 3 layers. Each of it accesses the layer below and ensures good maintenance and readability.

\subsubsection{I/O layer}

On this level we store the raw data. The methods related to this abstraction level are stored in Panda.Core/Core/IO.

\subsubsection{Block layer}

We have abstract blocks of uniform size. They are specified in the section Specification. The class blockManager manages the acces to these blocks. It communicates with the I/O layer.\\

With the blockManager we can allocate new blocks get data out blocks or access the blockOffset which contains block relevant data. The methods related to this abstraction level are stored in Panda.Core/Core/Blocks.

\subsubsection{Filesystem layer}

This is the most abstract level. Here we implemented the functionality of the VFS which are based on the requirements. It communicates with the Block layer via the blockManager.\\

The most important Classes are the VirtualDirectory.cs and VirtualFile.cs which inherit from VirtualNode.cs. With the node concept we realize the fact that a directory and file have many things in commen (they can be renamed, deleted, etc. ). Due to the integration of an enumerator we can acces a list of nodes very efficient.\\

The methods related to this abstraction level are stored in Panda.Core and  Panda.Core/Core/Internal.

\subsection{Specification}

This section lists the detailed specification of the blocksystem of the virtual file system.

\subsubsection{General Remarks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Offsets \& lengths in bytes.
	\item The VFS is organized in blocks with fixed BLOCK\_SIZE.
	\item All addresses are in number of blocks from 0 and of length 4 bytes.
	\item Only single links to blocks (not more than one hard-link) are allowed. This means that one file or directory can only be in one directory.
	\item Block address 0 is illegal, it means absence of a block.
	\item B\_S := BLOCK\_SIZE \& d-t := data-type
	\item Offsets are absolute
	\item Strings are encoded in UTF-8
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metadata}

Metadata of the whole VFS starts at address 0.\\

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{7cm}|}\hline
Offset 	&Length	&C\# d-t	&Description\\\hline
0	&4	&UInt32	&Number of blocks in entire VFS\\
4	&4	&UInt32	&BLOCK\_SIZE in bytes\\
8	&4	&UInt32	&Address of root directory node\\
12	&4	&UInt32	&Address of empty page block. Must never be 0\\
16	&4	&UInt32	&“break” in number of blocks, see empty space management.\\
20	&B\_S -20	&UInt32	&Empty (initialized with 0)\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\

Normal blocks are everywhere but at address 0.

\paragraph{Block Types}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Directory blocks (many different blocks, with optional continuation blocks)
	\item File blocks (many different blocks, with optional continuation blocks)
	\item Data blocks (many different blocks)
	\item Empty space block (exactly one block, with optional continuation blocks)
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Directory blocks} \mbox{} \\

Contain file / directory names of current directory and their block addresses.\\

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{7cm}|}\hline
Offset 	&Length	&C\# d-t	&Description\\\hline
0	&?	&-	&Arbitrary number of directory entries\\
B\_S - 4	&4	&UInt32	&Link to directory continuation block. 0 here marks absence of continuation blocks.\\\hline
\end{tabular} \\

Directory continuation blocks look the same as directory blocks and can link to other directory continuation blocks.

\subparagraph{Directory entry} \mbox{} \\

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{7cm}|}\hline
Offset 	&Length	&C\# d-t	&Description\\\hline
0	&1	&UInt8	&If first bit (the least significant) set (== 1), following address points to directory. Else to file.\\
2	&1	&UInt8	&Number of bytes in file name. 0 here marks end of directory block.\\
3	&X	&String	&File / directory name\\
X	&X + 4	&UInt32	&Address to file / directory block\\\hline
\end{tabular} \\

\subparagraph{File blocks} \mbox{} \\

Contain addresses to data blocks.\\

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{7cm}|}\hline
Offset 	&Length	&C\# d-t	&Description\\\hline
0	&8	&UInt64	&File size in bytes (to manage files smaller than block size)\\
8	&?	&UInt32	&Arbitrary number of addresses to data blocks\\
B\_S - 4	&4	&UInt32	&Link to file continuation block. 0 here marks absence of continuation blocks.\\\hline
\end{tabular} \\

File continuation blocks have file size 0 and can link to other file continuation blocks.

\subparagraph{File blocks} \mbox{} \\

Contain only plain binary data.

\subparagraph{Empty space block} \mbox{} \\

Contains addresses to empty blocks.\\

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{1.5cm}|p{7cm}|}\hline
Offset 	&Length	&C\# d-t	&Description\\\hline
0	&4	&UInt32	&Number of empty blocks in number of blocks\\
4	&?	&UInt32	&Arbitrary number of addresses to empty blocks\\
B\_S - 4	&4	&UInt32	&Link to empty space continuation block. 0 here marks absence of continuation blocks.\\\hline
\end{tabular} \\

\subsubsection{Empty space management}

The VFS is designed to maintain an index of unused blocks. The addresses of the unused blocks are stored in the empty space block. Its address is stored in the VFS meta-data. This empty space block may also have empty space continuation blocks. But not every address to an empty block in the whole VFS can be stored in this empty space block. Instead, only addresses of empty blocks up to a maximum address, which is called “break”, is stored in this block. If there are no empty blocks left, the “break” must be increased by 1, and the new empty block addresses must be added to the empty space block. If the block next to “break” is freed, decrease the “break”, otherwise the address of this block to the empty space block or its last continuation block.
